       "'Which Cars Have Self-Driving Features for 2021?\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long ago, fully autonomous vehicles for the masses were said to be just around the corner. As it turns out, making the final leap to full autonomy â€” self-driving on any road at any time â€” remains tantalizingly out of reach both for engineers and safety regulators. And despite all the attention such vehicles have drawn, Americans arenâ€™t exactly clamoring for self-driving cars: The latest AAA annual survey on automated vehicles found that just 14% of drivers would trust riding in a self-driving car, about the same as 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut tech features that form the building blocks for self-driving have spread quickly into mainstream vehicles in just a few years (check out our 2016 report here). These systems can now aid the driver with steering, acceleration and braking â€” though we stress that, no matter their capabilities, they are not truly self-driving. All such systems still require the driver to be in charge and ready to take over. \\r\\n\\r\\nKey among the current systems are adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering. The best ones function from highway speeds down to a full stop and can relieve you of much grunt work, both in congested commutes and in long hours on the highway. While most of these systems still require you to keep your hands on the wheel, a few now let you leave your hands off the wheel in certain situations. But no matter what you see on YouTube, none as of now let you safely take your eyes off the road to read, sleep or update your Instagram. (If you want more explanation about these features, youâ€™ll find it below, following the list.)\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the mass-market brands (excluding exotics and uber-luxury cars) that offer such high-level adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering for 2021. Note that for simplicityâ€™s sake, we list just the root nameplates; we donâ€™t break out related offshoots, such as alternate body styles that share major components and naming (e.g., the Toyota Corolla Hatchback or Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport), nor do we split off performance (e.g., the Audi S4) or electrified (e.g., the Ford Escape Hybrid) versions. We made a few exceptions where the feature is exclusive to just one variant, but we kept things at the overall model level for the most part.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlphabetically by brand, hereâ€™s the state of these self-driving features for the 2021 model year:\\r\\n\\r\\nAcura\\r\\nHands-on lane centering at higher speeds only:\\r\\n2021 Acura ILX\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop with hands-on lane centering at higher speeds only:\\r\\n2021 Acura RDX\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Acura TLX\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAcura bundles most driver-assist tech under its AcuraWatch suite of safety features. Depending on the vehicle, AcuraWatch includes a Lane Keeping Assist System, Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow, or both. Lane-centering steering via LKAS functions only from 45 mph up, but the TLX (and coming MDX) add Traffic Jam Assist with lane-centering steering down to a stop. Note that Acuraâ€™s MDX skipped the 2021 model year and the redesigned 2022, which just went on sale,  now includes hands-on lane-centering steering and adaptive cruise control, both of which can work down to a stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Acura Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nAlfa Romeo\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Alfa Romeo Giulia\\r\\n2021 Alfa Romeo Stelvio\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAdaptive Cruise Control with Full Stop, plus two lane-centering steering systems: Traffic Jam Assist, which works up to 37 mph, and the Highway Assist System, which works up to 90 mph on lane-marked highways intuited through GPS. Both are hands-on systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Alfa Romeo Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nAudi\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Audi A4\\r\\n2021 Audi A5\\r\\n2021 Audi A6\\r\\n2021 Audi A7\\r\\n2021 Audi A8\\r\\n2021 Audi E-tron\\r\\n2021 Audi Q3\\r\\n2021 Audi Q5\\r\\n2021 Audi Q7\\r\\n2021 Audi Q8\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAudi terminology varies. Traffic Jam Assist provides hands-on lane-centering steering at vehicle speeds up to around 40 mph. Active Lane Assist, which Audi also characterizes as lane centering, works above roughly 40 mph. For adaptive cruise control, look for Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go, sometimes simply called Adaptive Cruise Control or Adaptive Cruise Assist. Itâ€™s available on every 2021 Audi model except the R8 and TT sports cars. The TT also offers something called Active Lane Assist, but its version does not include lane centering. Note that the Audi A3 skipped the 2021 model year and the redesigned 2022 will include lane centering and adaptive cruise control to a stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Audi Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nBMW\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 BMW 2 Series coupe and convertible\\r\\n2021 BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe\\r\\n2021 BMW 4 Series\\r\\n2021 BMW i3\\r\\n2021 BMW X1\\r\\n2021 BMW X2\\r\\n2021 BMW Z4\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 BMW X3\\r\\n2021 BMW X4\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop, plus hands-free lane centering at lower speeds only:\\r\\n2021 BMW 3 Series\\r\\n2021 BMW 5 Series \\r\\n2021 BMW 7 Series\\r\\n2021 BMW 8 Series\\r\\n2021 BMW X5\\r\\n2021 BMW X6\\r\\n2021 BMW X7\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control that operates to a stop goes by Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go. A step beyond, Active Lane Keeping Assist and Extended Traffic Jam Assistant (sometimes called Active Driving Assistant for all three, including the cruise control) offer hands-on lane-centering steering that works to a stop in certain traffic conditions. Finally, Extended Traffic Jam Assistant,  â€” now available on more than half a dozen models new or substantially updated since 2019 â€” allows hands-free lane centering on certain divided highways at speeds up to 40 mph as long as youâ€™re paying attention (verified with a driver-facing camera). BMW is one of three brands in the U.S. (the others are Cadillac and Ford) to offer conditional hands-free driving for the 2021 model year, and more are coming. In our experience with ETJA, the system transitions to hands-on lane centering when you pass 40 mph.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch BMW Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nBuick\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Buick Enclave\\r\\n2021 Buick Encore GX\\r\\n2021 Buick Envision\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nDepending on the car, look for Adaptive Cruise Control-Advanced or Adaptive Cruise Control-Camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Buick Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nCadillac\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Cadillac XT4\\r\\n2021 Cadillac XT5\\r\\n2021 Cadillac XT6\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-free lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Cadillac CT4\\r\\n2021 Cadillac CT5\\r\\n2021 Cadillac Escalade\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAdaptive Cruise Control-Advanced or Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control. Hands-free lane-centering steering from a stop up to highway speeds, which you can activate on certain highways only, comes via Cadillacâ€™s Super Cruise system. Introduced for the 2018 model year, Super Cruise is no longer the only hands-free steering system in a U.S. production vehicle â€” Ford and BMW offer it now or will within the 2021 model year, and others have systems coming soon after that. Super Cruise doesnâ€™t relieve you of the need to pay attention: You have to be ready to take back the wheel, and it checks on you via a driver-facing camera.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Cadillac Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nChevrolet\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Chevrolet Blazer\\r\\n2021 Chevrolet Equinox\\r\\n2021 Chevrolet Malibu\\r\\n2021 Chevrolet Tahoe\\r\\n2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer\\r\\n2021 Chevrolet Traverse\\r\\n2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500\\r\\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAdaptive Cruise Control-Advanced or Adaptive Cruise Control-Camera, depending on the vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Chevrolet Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nChrysler\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Chrysler 300\\r\\n2021 Chrysler Pacifica\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAdaptive Cruise Control with Stop or Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Chrysler Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nDodge\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Dodge Charger\\r\\n2021 Dodge Durango\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nDepending on the model, Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop or Adaptive Cruise Control Plus with Full Stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Dodge Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nFord\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Ford Bronco\\r\\n2021 Ford Expedition\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Ford Bronco Sport\\r\\n2021 Ford Edge\\r\\n2021 Ford Escape\\r\\n2021 Ford Explorer\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-free lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Ford F-150\\r\\n2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nLook for Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, though some models carry simpler designations. Ford now has packaged many assistance features into a suite called Ford Co-Pilot360 Technology, though contents can vary by model or trim level. A more advanced suite, called Co-Pilot360 Assist Plus, adds hands-on lane-centering steering to a stop for most models itâ€™s offered on.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparately, a new option called Ford Co-Pilot360 Assist 2.0 with Active Drive Assist will debut on the Mustang Mach-E and the redesigned F-150. It will allow hands-free, though not attention-free, driving. Like with similar systems from BMW and Cadillac, a driver-facing camera ensures youâ€™re watching the road; the feature will work only on  certain divided highways approved by Ford. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Active Drive Assist software will come in the second half of the 2021 calendar year through over-the-air updates for vehicles already on the road. The hands-free lane centering can operate down to a stop, as thereâ€™s â€œno lower speed limit for ADA to function as long as other critical conditionsâ€\\x9d are met, a Ford spokesperson told Cars.com. Note, too, that the F-150 requires you to pay for a prep package with certain hardware to be able to get it; the hardware cannot be added later. The Mach-E has the prep package standard on most models.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Ford Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nGenesis\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Genesis G70\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Genesis G80\\r\\n2021 Genesis G90\\r\\n2021 Genesis GV80\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nSmart Cruise Control with Machine Learning, Lane Keeping Assist and Lane Following Assist (LFA enables hands-on lane-centering steering at vehicle speeds up to 95 mph). A feature called Highway Driving Assist (G90) or Highway Driving Assist II (an update in the G80 and GV80) enhances the capability of these systems on highways with GPS and navigation data to adjust for the specific location and road. HDA also now is available on some models from Genesisâ€™ parent automaker, Hyundai. The G70 offers only LKA. Although Genesis does not call it true lane centering our yearlong experience in the G70 found LKA generally centered the vehicle above 40 mph. A Genesis representative told Cars.com that the G70â€™s system would â€œautomatically steer at higher speeds to keep you within your lane but will not necessarily keep you centered.â€\\x9d \\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Genesis Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nGMC\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 GMC Acadia\\r\\n2021 GMC Sierra 1500\\r\\n2021 GMC Terrain\\r\\n2021 GMC Yukon\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAdaptive Cruise Control-Advanced or Adaptive Cruise Control-Camera, depending on the vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch GMC Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nHonda\\r\\nHands-on lane centering at higher speeds only:\\r\\n2021 Honda HR-V\\r\\n2021 Honda Passport\\r\\n2021 Honda Pilot\\r\\n2021 Honda Ridgeline\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop and hands-on lane centering at higher speeds only:\\r\\n2021 Honda Accord\\r\\n2021 Honda Civic\\r\\n2021 Honda Clarity\\r\\n2021 Honda CR-V\\r\\n2021 Honda Insight\\r\\n2021 Honda Odyssey\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nMost driver-assist tech is wrapped into a Honda Sensing suite of safety systems, but features vary. Honda Sensing includes a Lane-Keeping Assist System that enables hands-on lane-centering steering at higher speeds â€” not to be confused with similarly named LKA systems from other brands, which mostly intervene as you approach lane markings rather than actively centering. Six models pair LKAS with Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow, which works all the way to a stop. Four other models, however, pair it with adaptive cruise control that functions only at vehicle speeds above 22 mph.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Honda Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nHyundai\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Kona Electric\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Tucson\\r\\nHands-on lane centering down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Veloster\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Elantra\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Ioniq\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Nexo\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Palisade\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Santa Fe\\r\\n2021 Hyundai Sonata\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nSmart Cruise Control with Stop & Go and Lane Following Assist, which adds hands-on lane-centering steering to a stop. An additional feature called Highway Driving Assist â€” offered on the Elantra, Ioniq, Palisade, Santa Fe and Sonata â€” enhances these systems on highways with GPS and navigation data to adjust speed for the specific location and road. Hyundai dubs its overall suite of safety and driver-assist features SmartSense, though its specific contents can vary by vehicle. The LFA is not to be confused with Lane Keeping Assist, a separate feature on some vehicles that, in Cars.comâ€™s experience, makes subtle steering corrections to keep the car centered above moderate vehicle speeds, though Hyundai officials donâ€™t call it lane centering. \\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Hyundai Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nInfiniti\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Infiniti QX80\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop with hands-on lane centering at higher speeds only:\\r\\n2021 Infiniti Q50\\r\\n2021 Infiniti Q60\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2020 Infiniti QX50\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nInfiniti calls its adaptive cruise control with full-stop capabilities Intelligent Cruise Control with Full-Speed Range, or some variation of that label. Hands-on lane-centering steering at higher speeds (Q50 and Q60) goes by Active Lane Control, while Infinitiâ€™s most robust system â€” which includes lane centering all the way down to a stop â€” is the ProPilot Assist offered on the QX50 and on the upcoming 2022 QX55. Note that the Infiniti QX60 SUV is skipping the 2021 model year before a redesigned 2022 version appears later this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Infiniti Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nJaguar\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Jaguar E-Pace\\r\\n2021 Jaguar F-Pace\\r\\n2021 Jaguar XF\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Jaguar I-Pace\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAdaptive Cruise Control with Stop & Go constitutes adaptive cruise control down to a stop in slow-moving traffic, and it automatically resumes if the car ahead starts moving within a few seconds. Adaptive Cruise Control with Steering Assist adds hands-on lane-centering steering to a stop. Steering Assist is not to be confused with Lane Keep Assist on many Jaguar models. Despite a name similar to some brandsâ€™ lane-centering systems, Jaguarâ€™s LKA is a departure assist that nudges you back when you drift toward lane markings.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Jaguar Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nJeep\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Jeep Cherokee\\r\\n2021 Jeep Compass\\r\\n2021 Jeep Gladiator\\r\\n2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee\\r\\n2021 Jeep Wrangler\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nActive Drive Assist on the new Grand Cherokee L adds hands-on lane-centering steering, a first for Jeep. For the others, look for Adaptive Cruise Control Plus, Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop or simply Adaptive Cruise Control, depending on the model. Note that the Renegade also offers adaptive cruise control, but only the others above have full-stop capabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Jeep Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nKia\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Kia Niro\\r\\n2021 Kia Sedona\\r\\n2021 Kia Stinger\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Kia K5\\r\\n2021 Kia Niro EV\\r\\n2021 Kia Seltos\\r\\n2021 Kia Sorento\\r\\n2021 Kia Sportage\\r\\n2021 Kia Telluride\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nSmart Cruise Control with Stop & Go. On the Niro EV, Telluride, Sportage, Sorento, K5 and Seltos, hands-on lane-centering steering comes in the form of Lane Follow Assist. By contrast, Lane Keep Assist (sometimes Lane Keeping Assist) is a separate feature that Kia officials donâ€™t call lane centering, but Cars.comâ€™s experience in various Kia models has been that LKA generally keeps the car centered in its lane above vehicle speeds of around 40 mph. \\r\\n\\r\\nResearch Kia Vehicles\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Land Rover Defender\\r\\n2021 Land Rover Discovery\\r\\n2021 Land Rover Discovery Sport\\r\\n2021 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque\\r\\nAdaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering, both down to a stop:\\r\\n2021 Land Rover Range Rover\\r\\n2021 Land Rover Range Rover Sport\\r\\nWhat should I look for?\\r\\nAdaptive Cruise Control or Adaptive Cruise Control with Steering Assist, which adds hands-on lane-centering steering.

Want More Details? A Deeper Dive\\r\\nThe systems above have myriad technological differences and may require specific road conditions. Weâ€™ve found that real-world performance, smooth operation and ease of use also can vary. When shopping, itâ€™s a good idea to research any prospective vehicleâ€™s self-driving systems â€” how they work and whether they can do what you expect. And after you buy, insist that the dealerâ€™s tech specialist walks you through safe operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWant to know more about the types of systems named above? Read on for a deeper dive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdaptive Cruise Control to a Stop\\r\\nThe current â€œsmartâ€\\x9d cruise control systems build on conventional fixed-speed cruise control (which reportedly dates to Chryslers in 1958) and basic adaptive cruise control, which uses sensors and braking to maintain a selectable distance from the car ahead up to your set speed. (In the U.S., adaptive cruise control dates back to the 2000 Mercedes-Benz S-Class; it was limited for a time to luxury cars.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAdaptive cruise that maintains a set distance at highway speeds now is widely available, but systems that also function at lower speeds and can bring you to a full stop are increasingly available. Some full-speed systems will bring you to a stop in traffic, then require you to apply the brakes and reaccelerate afterward. Others can hold the vehicle at the stop and resume speed when the car ahead starts moving again (up to a given time limit). The systems use sensors such as radar, ultrasound, cameras or a combination. And the most advanced of these systems donâ€™t just monitor the vehicle directly ahead but look beyond it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLane-Centering Steering\\r\\nThis is not to be confused with lane departure steering assist, which nudges you back when you drift toward lane markings â€” and often pinballs you toward the opposite side of the lane. True lane centering tracks lane markings or the vehicle ahead, or both, and actively centers your vehicle in its lane. Almost all such systems require you to keep your hands on the wheel. Theyâ€™ll warn you and eventually shut off if its sensors detect your hands are off for more than a brief time. Lane-centering steering systems also will deactivate if lane markings disappear, such as with construction zones, merging lanes or bad weather. Most such systems now work from a stop up to highway speeds, but some more basic systems function only above or below certain speeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHands-Free Steering\\r\\nThese systems center the car within the lane without requiring your hands on the wheel. For 2021, three systems â€” Cadillacâ€™s Super Cruise, BMWâ€™s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant and Fordâ€™s Active Drive Assist â€” currently allow this or will enable it within the model year. But these systems still require your eyes on the road, and they verify this using interior cameras that watch you. The BMW system is designed, as its name suggests, for low-speed (under 40 mph) congestion on highways. The Cadillac and most others allow full-speed use, but only on pre-mapped, limited-access freeways in the U.S. and Canada using GPS and cloud-based map data. While Ford will be the first mainstream brand to offer such a system, Nissan will join with the rollout of its new Ariya electric SUV, coming first in Japan and expected in the U.S. in late 2021 with ProPilot Assist 2.0. Jeep also has a system coming for the 2022 Grand Cherokee L. And GM, the automaker behind Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC, plans to expand Super Cruise beyond Cadillac beginning with the 2022 model year.\\r\\n\\r\\nEyes-Free Driving\\r\\nAttention-free driving in a commercially available car isnâ€™t here yet. The first production car to allow limited eyes-free driving under certain low-speed conditions (and you still had to be ready to take over) was to be the latest generation of Audiâ€™s flagship A8 sedan with a Traffic Jam Pilot system using some two dozen camera, radar, sonic and laser sensors. It would have been a first step toward the next level of autonomy, but U.S. and global regulatory delays stalled the rollout and Audi has reportedly dropped the plan. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

       "\"How Google's Self-Driving Car Will Change Everything\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine getting into your car, typingâ€”or, better yet speakingâ€”a location into your vehicleâ€™s interface, then letting it drive you to your destination while you read a book, surf the web, or nap. Self-driving vehiclesâ€”the stuff of science fiction since the first roads were pavedâ€”are coming, and theyâ€™re going to radically change what itâ€™s like to get from point A to point B.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Google started the self-driving car project with the goal of driving autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes. In 2016, Waymo, an autonomous driving technology company, became a subsidiary of Alphabet, and Google's self-driving project became Waymo.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, Waymo has invited the public to join the first public trial of autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver and introduced its first fully autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver on public roads without anyone in the driverâ€™s seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\\r\\nThe hype around driverless cars has grown rapidly over the past several years, with many big technology companies getting behind the concept.\\r\\nGoogle launched its Waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe.\\r\\nThe company, along with several others in the tech and auto industries, is betting that driverless cars will soon change the way we get around in a major way.\\r\\nAmong the revolutionary changes will be safer roads, fewer fossil fuels, and lower transportation costs.\\r\\nBasic Technology Already In Use\\r\\nâ€œThe building blocks of driverless cars are on the road now,â€\\x9d explained Russ Rader, senior vice president of communications at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety1ï»¿. He pointed to the front-crash prevention systems that for several years have been able to warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if they donâ€™t react fast enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese systems were quickly followed by technology that allows cars to self-park by sizing up a free spot and automatically steering into it, with the driver only controlling the accelerator and brake pedals. Mercedes-Benz took autonomous driving even further when they introduced Drive Pilot, which allows the driver to hand over direct control of steering and speed in certain circumstances, while still supervising the overall operation of the car.2ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Waymo announced that they would be making self-driving cars available by 2020. However, despite some extraordinary advancements, in the year 2020, self-driving cars are still out of reach, except in some trial programs.3ï»¿ The current technology on the market is limited to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision, cars that help keep you in your lane, and cars that can mostly handle highway driving.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. The car should react if itâ€™s about to steer into one. And once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination. In the end, you might say that the execution of these ideas has been more complicated than was anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaymo's cars, the leader in self-driving technology, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging, which is a way of estimating the distance to another object by bouncing light and sound off things). This technology helps the self-driving car identify where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where theyâ€™re moving.4ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nA Drastic Change\\r\\nWith the adoption of any new revolutionary technology, it is predicted there will be problems for businesses that donâ€™t adjust fast enough to future developments in self-driving car technology. Futurists estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars (if not trillions) will be lost by automakers, suppliers, dealers, insurers, parking companies, and many other car-related enterprises. And think of the lost revenue for governments via licensing fees, taxes and tolls, and by personal injury lawyers and health insurers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho needs a car made with heavier-gauge steel and eight airbags (not to mention a body shop) if accidents are so rare? Who needs a parking spot close to work if your car can drive you there, park itself miles away, only to pick you up later? Who needs to buy a flight from Boston to Cleveland when you can leave in the evening, sleep much of the way, and arrive in the morning?\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, one of Googleâ€™s goals is to facilitate car-sharing.5ï»¿ That means fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars, period. Who needs to own a car when you can just order a shared one and itâ€™ll drive up minutes later, ready to take you wherever you want?\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThis [has the potential to] dramatically reduce the number of cars on the street, 80% of which have people driving alone in them, and also a household's cost of transportation, which is 18% of their incomeâ€”around $9,000 a yearâ€”for an asset that they use only 5% of the time,â€\\x9d said Robin Chase, the founder and CEO of Buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, and co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2030, self-driving cars are expected to create $87 billion worth of opportunities for automakers and technology developers, said a report by Boston-based Lux Research.6ï»¿ Software developers stand to win big.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Manufacturing Revolution\\r\\nIf youâ€™re an automaker, such as Ford Motor Co. (F), General Motors Co. (GM), Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp. or Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), which account for almost 70% of the U.S. market, you could see an initial surge in the $600 billion in annual new and used car sales globally.7ï»¿ 8ï»¿ But as soon as the technology takes hold, sales could fall off significantly as sharing popularizes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCars will always need steel, glass, an interior, a drivetrain, and some form of human interface (even if that interface is little more than a wireless connection to your smartphone). But much of everything else could change. As an example, take front-facing seats; they could become an option, not a requirement. Automakers that see the changes comingâ€”such as how the big profits are secured downstream by car servicers, insurers, and moreâ€”are focusing on services as much as on what and how they manufacture.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrastructure Transformation\\r\\nWith fewer cars around, parking lots and spaces that cover roughly one-third of the land area of many U.S. cities can be repurposed. That could mean temporary downward pressure on real estate values as supply increases. It could also mean greener urban areas and revitalized suburbs if longer commutes become more palatable. And if fewer cars are on the road, federal, state, and local government agencies may be able to reallocate a good portion of the roughly $180 billion spent annually on highways and roads.9ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging Oil Demand\\r\\nIf youâ€™re in the business of finding, extracting, refining, and marketing hydrocarbons, such as Exxon Mobil (EOX), Chevron (CVX), or BP (BP), you could see your business fluctuate as use changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThese vehicles should practice very efficient eco-driving practices, which is typically about 20% better than the average driver,â€\\x9d said Chase. â€œOn the other hand, if these cars are owned by individuals, I see a huge rise in the number of trips, and vehicle miles traveled. People will send out their car to run errands they would never do if they had to be in the car and waste their own time. If the autonomous cars are shared vehicles and people pay for each trip, I think this will reduce demand, and thus (vehicle miles traveled).â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSafety Dividend\\r\\nAutonomous vehicles are also expected to be safer. â€œThese cars won't get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risksâ€”things people do all the time,â€\\x9d Chase said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œOver 90% of accidents today are caused by driver error,â€\\x9d said Professor Robert W. Peterson of the Center for Insurance Law and Regulation at Santa Clara University School of Law. â€œThere is every reason to believe that self-driving cars will reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, so insurance costs should fall, perhaps dramatically.â€\\x9d10ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œCars can still get flooded, damaged, or stolen,â€\\x9d notes Michael Barry, vice president of media relations at the Insurance Information Institute. â€œBut this technology will have a dramatic impact on underwriting. A lot of traditional underwriting criteria will be upended.â€\\x9d11ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nBarry said itâ€™s too early to quantify exactly how self-driving vehicles will affect rates, but added that injured parties in a crash involving a self-driving car may choose to sue the vehicleâ€™s manufacturer or the software company that designed the autonomous capability.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, insurers such as State Farm Insurance, Allstate Corp. (ALL), Liberty Mutual Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.â€™s (BRK-A) GEICO, Citigroup Inc.â€™s (C) Travelers Group could see a huge benefit from lower accident liabilities. But they may wind up losing a big portion of the $200 billion in personal auto premiums they write every year as fewer cars take to the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome experts have even speculated that mandatory insurance for cars could be dropped. And as long as weâ€™re talking about financial services, what about the multitude of banks and creditors that lend buyers money in about 85% of car purchases if sales volume falls?12ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a University of Texas report, if only 10% of the cars on U.S. roads were autonomous, almost $30 billion of savings could be realized via less wasted time and fuel, as well as fewer injuries and deaths. At 90%, the benefit rises to almost $120 billion a year.13ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nCloser to Home\\r\\nSelf-driving cars could have a substantial impact on the taxi and limousine industries and could potentially create new ones. Chase noted that they could be used to share specific trips, as a kind of pay-as-you-go small-scale public transportationâ€”for example, taking a disparate bunch of Manhattanites to the same beach in the Hamptons in one trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne study found that a fleet of 9,000 driverless taxis could serve all of Manhattan at about $0.50 per mile (compared to about $5 per mile now). At the time the study was published, there were licenses for over 13,000 taxis in New York City.14ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-driving cars may also challenge train lines. â€œA self-driving car offers much of the convenience of rail service with the added convenience that the service is portal-to-portal rather than station-to-station,â€\\x9d Peterson said.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œOn the other hand, a fleet of self-driving cars available at the station may make rail service more palatable. â€œThe technology has already been adopted in closed systems, such as campuses, air-terminals, and mining,â€\\x9d he noted. â€œRio Tinto Group (RIO), a large mining company, uses enormous self-driving trucks in its mining operations. European countries are experimenting with the platooning of trucks. Among other things, this saves about 18% in fuel.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRisks and Hurdles\\r\\nThere are regulatory and legislative obstacles to the widespread use of self-driving cars and substantial concerns about privacy. (Who will have access to any driving information these vehicles store?) Thereâ€™s also the question of security, as hackers could theoretically take control of these vehicles, and are not known for their restraint or civic-mindedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Future of Waymo\\r\\nIn March 2020, Waymo Via, the trucking division of Waymo, was launched. According to Google, since 2017 Waymo Driver had been learning to drive large Class 8 trucks in the same way that it had learned how to drive passenger vehicles. Waymo is currently testing its fleet of trucks in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, and has launched a pilot program for local delivery in the Phoenix, Arizona area.15ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nWaymo has partnerships with multiple vehicle manufacturers to integrate its technology. In October 2020, Waymo and Daimler Trucks partnered to create an autonomous version of the Freightliner Cascadia truck. This is Waymo's first foray into the freight industry. Daimler's trucks will be equipped with autonomous technology that allows them to drive without a human but only in pre-defined areas.16ï»¿\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogleâ€™s Self-Driving Car FAQs\\r\\nIs Google Making a Car?\\r\\nGoogle has made it clear that it has no plans to build cars itself. Waymo is a self-driving technology company; it does not intend to manufacture and sell its own line of vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Year Will There Be Self-Driving Cars?\\r\\nEarly estimates about self-driving cars being the norm by 2020 have turned into having a few research vehicles on the road by 2020. Even if the technology is not developing as fast as expected, computer-processing capabilities and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are becoming more advanced and more affordable every year. It's not clear when all the pieces will truly fall into place to allow for driverless technologies to safely navigate public roads among traditional cars. While experts agree that there will be a time in the future when this is true, they disagree on the timeline.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Much Does the Google Car Cost?\\r\\nGoogle does not manufacture or sell its own cars. However, you can purchase a semi-autonomous Honda Civic that comes with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that control the steering, lane changing, acceleration, and braking while the car is cruising on the highway. You can also purchase a Tesla Motors vehicle that comes equipped with its semi-autonomous Autopilot feature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bottom Line\\r\\nHowever it plays out, these vehicles are comingâ€”and fast. Their full adoption will take decades, but their convenience, cost, safety, and other factors will make them ubiquitous and indispensable. Such as with any technological revolution, the companies that plan ahead, adjust the fastest, and imagine the biggest will survive and thrive. And companies invested in old technology and practices will need to evolve or risk dying.\""

       "\"how google's self-driving car will change everything imagine getting into your car, typingâ€”or, better yet speakingâ€”a location into your vehicleâ€™s interface, then letting it drive you to your destination while you read a book, surf the web, or nap. self-driving vehiclesâ€”the stuff of science fiction since the first roads were pavedâ€”are coming, and theyâ€™re going to radically change what itâ€™s like to get from point a to point b. in 2009, google started the self-driving car project with the goal of driving autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes. in 2016, waymo, an autonomous driving technology company, became a subsidiary of alphabet, and google's self-driving project became waymo. since then, waymo has invited the public to join the first public trial of autonomous vehicles operated by the waymo driver and introduced its first fully autonomous vehicles operated by the waymo driver on public roads without anyone in the driverâ€™s seat. key takeaways  the hype around driverless cars has grown rapidly over the past several years, with many big technology companies getting behind the concept.  google launched its waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe.  the company, along with several others in the tech and auto industries, is betting that driverless cars will soon change the way we get around in a major way.  among the revolutionary changes will be safer roads, fewer fossil fuels, and lower transportation costs.  basic technology already in use  â€œthe building blocks of driverless cars are on the road now,â€\\x9d explained russ rader, senior vice president of communications at the insurance institute for highway safety1ï»¿. he pointed to the front-crash prevention systems that for several years have been able to warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if they donâ€™t react fast enough. these systems were quickly followed by technology that allows cars to self-park by sizing up a free spot and automatically steering into it, with the driver only controlling the accelerator and brake pedals. mercedes-benz took autonomous driving even further when they introduced drive pilot, which allows the driver to hand over direct control of steering and speed in certain circumstances, while still supervising the overall operation of the car.2ï»¿ in 2018, waymo announced that they would be making self-driving cars available by 2020. however, despite some extraordinary advancements, in the year 2020, self-driving cars are still out of reach, except in some trial programs.3ï»¿ the current technology on the market is limited to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision, cars that help keep you in your lane, and cars that can mostly handle highway driving. the idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. the car should react if itâ€™s about to steer into one. and once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination. in the end, you might say that the execution of these ideas has been more complicated than was anticipated. waymo's cars, the leader in self-driving technology, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging, which is a way of estimating the distance to another object by bouncing light and sound off things). this technology helps the self-driving car identify where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where theyâ€™re moving.4ï»¿ a drastic change  with the adoption of any new revolutionary technology, it is predicted there will be problems for businesses that donâ€™t adjust fast enough to future developments in self-driving car technology. futurists estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars (if not trillions) will be lost by automakers, suppliers, dealers, insurers, parking companies, and many other car-related enterprises. and think of the lost revenue for governments via licensing fees, taxes and tolls, and by personal injury lawyers and health insurers. who needs a car made with heavier-gauge steel and eight airbags (not to mention a body shop) if accidents are so rare? who needs a parking spot close to work if your car can drive you there, park itself miles away, only to pick you up later? who needs to buy a flight from boston to cleveland when you can leave in the evening, sleep much of the way, and arrive in the morning? indeed, one of googleâ€™s goals is to facilitate car-sharing.5ï»¿ that means fewer cars on the road. fewer cars, period. who needs to own a car when you can just order a shared one and itâ€™ll drive up minutes later, ready to take you wherever you want? â€œthis [has the potential to] dramatically reduce the number of cars on the street, 80% of which have people driving alone in them, and also a household's cost of transportation, which is 18% of their incomeâ€”around $9,000 a yearâ€”for an asset that they use only 5% of the time,â€\\x9d said robin chase, the founder and ceo of buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, and co-founder and former ceo of zipcar. in 2030, self-driving cars are expected to create $87 billion worth of opportunities for automakers and technology developers, said a report by boston-based lux research.6ï»¿ software developers stand to win big. a manufacturing revolution  if youâ€™re an automaker, such as ford motor co. (f), general motors co. (gm), chrysler group llc, toyota motor corp. or honda motor co., ltd. (hmc), which account for almost 70% of the u.s. market, you could see an initial surge in the $600 billion in annual new and used car sales globally.7ï»¿ 8ï»¿ but as soon as the technology takes hold, sales could fall off significantly as sharing popularizes. cars will always need steel, glass, an interior, a drivetrain, and some form of human interface (even if that interface is little more than a wireless connection to your smartphone). but much of everything else could change. as an example, take front-facing seats; they could become an option, not a requirement. automakers that see the changes comingâ€”such as how the big profits are secured downstream by car servicers, insurers, and moreâ€”are focusing on services as much as on what and how they manufacture. infrastructure transformation  with fewer cars around, parking lots and spaces that cover roughly one-third of the land area of many u.s. cities can be repurposed. that could mean temporary downward pressure on real estate values as supply increases. it could also mean greener urban areas and revitalized suburbs if longer commutes become more palatable. and if fewer cars are on the road, federal, state, and local government agencies may be able to reallocate a good portion of the roughly $180 billion spent annually on highways and roads.9ï»¿ changing oil demand  if youâ€™re in the business of finding, extracting, refining, and marketing hydrocarbons, such as exxon mobil (eox), chevron (cvx), or bp (bp), you could see your business fluctuate as use changes. â€œthese vehicles should practice very efficient eco-driving practices, which is typically about 20% better than the average driver,â€\\x9d said chase. â€œon the other hand, if these cars are owned by individuals, i see a huge rise in the number of trips, and vehicle miles traveled. people will send out their car to run errands they would never do if they had to be in the car and waste their own time. if the autonomous cars are shared vehicles and people pay for each trip, i think this will reduce demand, and thus (vehicle miles traveled).â€\\x9d safety dividend  autonomous vehicles are also expected to be safer. â€œthese cars won't get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risksâ€”things people do all the time,â€\\x9d chase said. â€œover 90% of accidents today are caused by driver error,â€\\x9d said professor robert w. peterson of the center for insurance law and regulation at santa clara university school of law. â€œthere is every reason to believe that self-driving cars will reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, so insurance costs should fall, perhaps dramatically.â€\\x9d10ï»¿ â€œcars can still get flooded, damaged, or stolen,â€\\x9d notes michael barry, vice president of media relations at the insurance information institute. â€œbut this technology will have a dramatic impact on underwriting. a lot of traditional underwriting criteria will be upended.â€\\x9d11ï»¿ barry said itâ€™s too early to quantify exactly how self-driving vehicles will affect rates, but added that injured parties in a crash involving a self-driving car may choose to sue the vehicleâ€™s manufacturer or the software company that designed the autonomous capability. initially, insurers such as state farm insurance, allstate corp. (all), liberty mutual group, berkshire hathaway inc.â€™s (brk-a) geico, citigroup inc.â€™s (c) travelers group could see a huge benefit from lower accident liabilities. but they may wind up losing a big portion of the $200 billion in personal auto premiums they write every year as fewer cars take to the road. some experts have even speculated that mandatory insurance for cars could be dropped. and as long as weâ€™re talking about financial services, what about the multitude of banks and creditors that lend buyers money in about 85% of car purchases if sales volume falls?12ï»¿ according to a university of texas report, if only 10% of the cars on u.s. roads were autonomous, almost $30 billion of savings could be realized via less wasted time and fuel, as well as fewer injuries and deaths. at 90%, the benefit rises to almost $120 billion a year.13ï»¿ closer to home  self-driving cars could have a substantial impact on the taxi and limousine industries and could potentially create new ones. chase noted that they could be used to share specific trips, as a kind of pay-as-you-go small-scale public transportationâ€”for example, taking a disparate bunch of manhattanites to the same beach in the hamptons in one trip. one study found that a fleet of 9,000 driverless taxis could serve all of manhattan at about $0.50 per mile (compared to about $5 per mile now). at the time the study was published, there were licenses for over 13,000 taxis in new york city.14ï»¿ self-driving cars may also challenge train lines. â€œa self-driving car offers much of the convenience of rail service with the added convenience that the service is portal-to-portal rather than station-to-station,â€\\x9d peterson said. â€œon the other hand, a fleet of self-driving cars available at the station may make rail service more palatable. â€œthe technology has already been adopted in closed systems, such as campuses, air-terminals, and mining,â€\\x9d he noted. â€œrio tinto group (rio), a large mining company, uses enormous self-driving trucks in its mining operations. european countries are experimenting with the platooning of trucks. among other things, this saves about 18% in fuel.â€\\x9d risks and hurdles  there are regulatory and legislative obstacles to the widespread use of self-driving cars and substantial concerns about privacy. (who will have access to any driving information these vehicles store?) thereâ€™s also the question of security, as hackers could theoretically take control of these vehicles, and are not known for their restraint or civic-mindedness. the future of waymo  in march 2020, waymo via, the trucking division of waymo, was launched. according to google, since 2017 waymo driver had been learning to drive large class 8 trucks in the same way that it had learned how to drive passenger vehicles. waymo is currently testing its fleet of trucks in california, arizona, new mexico, and texas, and has launched a pilot program for local delivery in the phoenix, arizona area.15ï»¿ waymo has partnerships with multiple vehicle manufacturers to integrate its technology. in october 2020, waymo and daimler trucks partnered to create an autonomous version of the freightliner cascadia truck. this is waymo's first foray into the freight industry. daimler's trucks will be equipped with autonomous technology that allows them to drive without a human but only in pre-defined areas.16ï»¿ googleâ€™s self-driving car faqs  is google making a car?  google has made it clear that it has no plans to build cars itself. waymo is a self-driving technology company; it does not intend to manufacture and sell its own line of vehicles. what year will there be self-driving cars?  early estimates about self-driving cars being the norm by 2020 have turned into having a few research vehicles on the road by 2020. even if the technology is not developing as fast as expected, computer-processing capabilities and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are becoming more advanced and more affordable every year. it's not clear when all the pieces will truly fall into place to allow for driverless technologies to safely navigate public roads among traditional cars. while experts agree that there will be a time in the future when this is true, they disagree on the timeline. how much does the google car cost?  google does not manufacture or sell its own cars. however, you can purchase a semi-autonomous honda civic that comes with advanced driver assistance systems (adas) that control the steering, lane changing, acceleration, and braking while the car is cruising on the highway. you can also purchase a tesla motors vehicle that comes equipped with its semi-autonomous autopilot feature. the bottom line  however it plays out, these vehicles are comingâ€”and fast. their full adoption will take decades, but their convenience, cost, safety, and other factors will make them ubiquitous and indispensable. such as with any technological revolution, the companies that plan ahead, adjust the fastest, and imagine the biggest will survive and thrive. and companies invested in old technology and practices will need to evolve or risk dying.\""

computer-processing capabilities and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are becoming more advanced and more affordable every year it not clear when all the pieces will truly fall into place to allow for driverless technologies to safely navigate public roads among traditional cars while experts agree that there will be a time in the future when this is true they disagree on the timeline

technology company become a subsidiary of alphabet and google self-driving project become waymo since then waymo have invite the public to join the first public trial of autonomous vehicles operate by the waymo driver and introduce its first fully autonomous vehicles operate by the waymo driver on public roads without anyone in the driverâ€™s seat key takeaways  the hype around driverless cars have grow rapidly over the past several years with many big technology company get behind the concept  google launch its waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe  the company along with several others in the tech and auto industries be bet that driverless cars will soon change the way we get around in a major way  among the revolutionary change will be

control the accelerator and brake pedal mercedes-benz take autonomous drive even further when they introduce drive pilot which allow the driver to hand over direct control of steer and speed in certain circumstances while still supervise the overall operation of the car2ï»¿ in 2018 waymo announce that they would be make self-driving cars available by 2020 however despite some extraordinary advancements in the year 2020 self-driving cars be still out of reach except in some trial programs3ï»¿ the current technology on the market be limit to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision cars that help keep you in your lane and cars that can mostly handle highway drive the idea behind self-driving cars be fairly simple build a car with cameras that can track all the object around it the car should react if itâ€™s about to steer into one and once in-car computers know all drive rule they should be able to navigate to their destination in the end you might say that the execution of these ideas have be more complicate than be anticipate waymo cars the leader in self-driving technology use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and range

car-related enterprises and think of the lose revenue for governments via license fee tax and toll and by personal injury lawyers and health insurers who need a car make with heavier-gauge steel and eight airbags (not to mention a body shop) if accidents be so rare who need a park spot close to work if your car can drive you there park itself miles away only to pick you up later who need to buy a
